# Questions: How the abnormal NBA COVID-19 Season ("the bubble" from 2019-2020) affected NBA player performance in the NBA Playoffs?, How player performance and physicality rates changed by looking at changes in MPG, PG, PPG, APG, RPG, 3PA, DRTG in correlation to aggressivity and willingness to space themselves physically during the Playoffs? Are any of the changes observed from the COVID-19 season statistically significant?

    # This graph is a histogram showing the difference in points per player from the COVID-19 Playoff Season to the regular seasons that followed. The x-axis shows point differentials (-10 -> 10) and the y-axis shows the number of players. This can help us make the inferance that while although the Points Per Game (PPG) for the majority of players stayed the same, the graph did not follow a normal bell-curve distribution and was instead skewed right meaning players were more likely to enter a negative point differential than positive.
